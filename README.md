# Lejos-NXT
University Year 3, Assignment for Robotic Autonomous

For the robotics module, I implemented a variety of functionality directly to a robot controller which performed a specific action, for example mapping an area out. This involved programming on two platforms provided by LEGO which are known as the NXT and EV3. The robotic system received commands wirelessly from the computer and completed an action autonomously. The robot itself consisted of different types of sensors, for instance Infrared and Ultrasonic to gather information about its environmenm, this information was then transmitted back to the computer to showcase its localization within the environment.
